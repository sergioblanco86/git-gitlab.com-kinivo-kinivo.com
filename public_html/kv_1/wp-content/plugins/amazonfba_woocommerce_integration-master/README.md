# Amazon FBA Woocommerce Integration
## About this plugin
This plugin was built to stop people from having to copy and paste order details from Woocommerce to Amazon to utilise Fulfilment by Amazon (FBA).
It also means that people who haven't want to use this in the past now can. Integrating these two products aim to achieve the following tasks.
* Retrieve inventory level from Amazons warehouse and update Woocommerce stock level.
* Send orders fulfillable by Amazon to Amazon.
* Retrieve static updates from Amazon and update Woocommerce orders accordingly.
* Retrieve tracking information and populate the orders post_meta accordingly.

## v2 Released
AmazonFBA Woocommerce Integration v2 has been released. V2 Includes the following changes.

* Custom synchronisation cron schedules (configurable in settings).
* Utilises standardized Woocommerce Integration API
* Button on Order page to send for fulfilment (manual fulfilment by Amazon).
* Re-structered code for increased stability.
* Ability to toggle logging(debug) on/off (configurable in settings).
* Moved pages around to make more sense, product mapping is now under products menu in woocommerce, settings in now under integration on Woocommerce > Settings.
